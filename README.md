Record my favorite and useful deep learning models encountered in the learning process, including but not limited to classic convolutional neural networks (e.g. AlexNet,ResNet), attention-mechanism related modules, transformer related models (e.g. ViT,Efficient ViT), etc.

 I will continue to update more models as I learn. All models are based on the pytorch implementation and use cuda version 11.8. Another important point is that a large number of implemented models are available in the pytorch framework and transformers library. Reading the source code will improve your coding skills.
